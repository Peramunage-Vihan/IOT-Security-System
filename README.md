# IOT-Security-System
This is an Arduino-based IoT security system for a documentary room that implements fire detection, unknown entry detection, secrete code entry, etc.

**Overview**

The Pentagon is the headquarters building of the United States Department of Defense. It was constructed on an accelerated schedule during World War II. As a symbol of the U.S. military, the phrase The Pentagon is often used as a metonym for the Department of Defense and its leadership.The Pentagon is the world's largest office building, with about 6.5 million square feet (150 acres; 60 ha) of floor space, of which 3.7 million sq ft (85 acres; 34 ha) are used as offices.[6][7] Some 23,000 military and civilian employees,[7] and another 3,000 non-defense support personnel, work in the Pentagon. It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, and five ring corridors per floor with a total of 17.5 miles (28.2 km)[7] of corridors.

**Our Goals**
1. To measure the temperature of the control center is monitored for fire detection
2. To build a MorseCode to enter secret passphrase to the server room using LDR and Light (PhoneTorch)
